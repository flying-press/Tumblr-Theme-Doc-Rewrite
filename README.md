# Rewrite of Tumblr's Theme documentation

I am writing this because I feel like what Tumblr has for its [theme documentation](https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_themes) is really lacking. Some things have to be figured out through trial-and-error and looking through others' code; or there is not much of a clear explanation of what the variables do, and how they are implemented to create a functioning theme.

I am open to any help or any ideas for how to make the documentation better. Something I should say? Something I should add? Something that I am doing wrong? Anything!
